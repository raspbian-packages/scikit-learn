Description: some examples require network access (and thus get stuck at times), etc
      so to robustify builds of the debian packages across platforms, for now
      gallery is disabled
Remark by Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org> while refreshing patches:
  The option to set `plot_gallery = False` was removed from upstream source.
  May be we need to exclude those tests by other means
