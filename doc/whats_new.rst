Highlights
.............

   - Gradient boosted regression trees (:ref:`gradient_boosting`)
     for classification and regression by `Peter Prettenhofer`_
     and `Scott White`_ .

   - Simple dict-based feature loader with support for categorical variables
     (:class:`feature_extraction.DictVectorizer`) by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added Matthews correlation coefficient (:func:`metrics.matthews_corrcoef`)
     and added macro and micro average options to
     :func:`metrics.precision_score`, :func:`metrics.recall_score` and
     :func:`metrics.f1_score` by `Satrajit Ghosh`_.

   - :ref:`out_of_bag` of generalization error for :ref:`ensemble`
     by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - :ref:`randomized_l1`: Randomized sparse linear models for feature
     selection, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - :ref:`label_propagation` for semi-supervised learning, by Clay
     Woolam. **Note** the semi-supervised API is still work in progress,
     and may change.

   - Added BIC/AIC model selection to classical :ref:`gmm` and unified
     the API with the remainder of scikit-learn, by `Bertrand Thirion`_

   - Added :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`, which is
     a :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` with balanced splits,
     by `Yannick Schwartz`.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid` classifier added, along with a
     ``shrink_threshold`` parameter, which implements **shrunken centroid
     classification**, by `Robert Layton`_.

Other changes
..............

   - Merged dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`sgd` module and
     exposed utility extension types for sequential
     datasets `seq_dataset` and weight vectors `weight_vector`
     by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added `partial_fit` (support for online/minibatch learning) and
     warm_start to the :ref:`sgd` module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`svm` classes and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` merged by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Regressors can now be used as base estimator in the :ref:`multiclass`
     module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added n_jobs option to :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`
     and :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels` for parallel computation,
     by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - :ref:`k_means` can now be run in parallel, using the `n_jobs` argument
     to either :ref:`k_means` or :class:`KMeans`, by `Robert Layton`_.

   - Improved :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search` documentation
     and introduced the new :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     helper function by `Olivier Grisel`_

   - :class:`svm.SVC` members `coef_` and `intercept_` changed sign for consistency
     with `decision_function`; for ``kernel==linear``, `coef_` was fixed
     in the the one-vs-one case, by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Performance improvements to efficient leave-one-out cross-validated
     Ridge regression, esp. for the ``n_samples > n_features`` case, in
     :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV`, by Reuben Fletcher-Costin.

   - Refactoring and simplication of the :ref:`text_feature_extraction`
     API and fixed a bug that caused possible negative IDF,
     by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module has been removed since it
     is difficult to cythonize. If you are interested in contributing a cython
     version, you can use the python version in the git history as a reference.

   - Classes in :ref:`neighbors` now support arbitrary Minkowski metric for 
     nearest neighbors searches. The metric can be specified by argument ``p``.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` is now deprecated - Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope`
     instead.
  
   - `NeighborsClassifier` and `NeighborsRegressor` are gone in the module
     :ref:`neighbors`. Use the classes :class:`KNeighborsClassifier`,
     :class:`RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, :class:`KNeighborsRegressor`
     and/or :class:`RadiusNeighborsRegressor` instead.

   - Sparse classes in the :ref:`sgd` module are now deprecated.

   - In :class:`mixture.GMM`, :class:`mixture.DPGMM` and :class:`mixture.VBGMM`,
     parameters must be passed to an object when initialising it and not through
     ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - methods `rvs` and `decode` in :class:`GMM` module are now deprecated.
     `sample` and `score` or `predict` should be used instead.

   - attribute `_scores` and `_pvalues` in univariate feature selection
     objects are now deprecated.
     `scores_` or `pvalues_` should be used instead.

   - In :class:`LogisticRegression`, :class:`LinearSVC`, :class:`SVC` and
     :class:`NuSVC`, the `class_weight` parameter is now an initialization
     parameter, not a parameter to fit. This makes grid searches
     over this parameter possible.

   - LFW ``data`` is now always shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` to be
     consistent with the Olivetti faces dataset. Use ``images`` and
     ``pairs`` attribute to access the natural images shapes instead.

   - In :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, the meaning of the `multi_class` parameter changed.
     Options now are 'ovr' and 'crammer_singer', with 'ovr' being the default.
     This does not change the default behavior but hopefully is less confusing.

   - Classs :class:`feature_selection.text.Vectorizer` is deprecated and
     replaced by :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer`.

   - The preprocessor / analyzer nested structure for text feature
     extraction has been removed. All those features are
     now directly passed as flat constructor arguments
     to :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer`, in particular the
     following parameters are now used:

       - ``analyzer`` can be `'word'` or `'char'` to switch the default
         analysis scheme, or use a specific python callable (as previously).

       - ``tokenizer`` and ``preprocessor`` have been introduced to make it
         still possible to customize those steps with the new API.

       - ``input`` explicitly control how to interpret the sequence passed to
         ``fit`` and ``predict``: filenames, file objects or direct (byte or
         unicode) strings.

       - charset decoding is explicit and strict by default.

       - the ``vocabulary``, fitted or not is now stored in the
         ``vocabulary_`` attribute to be consistent with the project
         conventions.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` now derives directly
     from :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer` to make grid
     search trivial.

   - methods `rvs` in :class:`_BaseHMM` module are now deprecated.
     `sample` should be used instead.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module is removed since it is
     difficult to be Cythonized. If you are interested, you can look in the
     history codes by git.

   - The SVMlight format loader now supports files with both zero-based and
     one-based column indices, since both occur "in the wild".

   - Arguments in class :class:`ShuffleSplit` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``test_fraction`` and
     ``train_fraction`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Arguments in class :class:`Bootstrap` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``n_test`` and
     ``n_train`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Argument ``p`` added to classes in :ref:`neighbors` to specify an 
     arbitrary Minkowski metric for nearest neighbors searches.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when updgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.9:

  - Some estimators that may overwrite their inputs to save memory previously
    had ``overwrite_`` parameters; these have been replaced with ``copy_``
    parameters with exactly the opposite meaning.

    This particularly affects some of the estimators in :mod:`linear_model`.
    The default behavior is still to copy everything passed in.

  - The SVMlight dataset loader :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_svmlight_file` no
    longer supports loading two files at once; use ``load_svmlight_files``
    instead. Also, the (unused) ``buffer_mb`` parameter is gone.

  - Sparse estimators in the :ref:`sgd` module use dense parameter vector
    ``coef_`` instead of ``sparse_coef_``. This significantly improves
    test time performance.

  - The :ref:`covariance` module now has a robust estimator of
    covariance, the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator.

  - Cluster evaluation metrics in :mod:`metrics.cluster` have been refactored
    but the changes are backwards compatible. They have been moved to the
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.supervised`, along with
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.unsupervised` which contains the Silhouette
    Coefficient.

  - The ``permutation_test_score`` function now behaves the same way as
    ``cross_val_score`` (i.e. uses the mean score across the folds.)

  - Cross Validation generators now use integer indices (``indices=True``)
    by default instead of boolean masks. This make it more intuitive to
    use with sparse matrix data.

  - The functions used for sparse coding, ``sparse_encode`` and
    ``sparse_encode_parallel`` have been combined into
    :func:`sklearn.decomposition.sparse_encode`, and the shapes of the arrays
    have been transposed for consistency with the matrix factorization setting,
    as opposed to the regression setting.

  - Fixed an off-by-one error in the SVMlight/LibSVM file format handling;
    files generated using :func:`sklearn.datasets.dump_svmlight_file` should be
    re-generated. (They should continue to work, but accidentally had one
    extra column of zeros prepended.)

  - ``BaseDictionaryLearning`` class replaced by ``SparseCodingMixin``.

  - :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.fast_svd` has been renamed
    :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd` and the default
    oversampling is now fixed to 10 additional random vectors instead
    of doubling the number of components to extract. The new behavior
    follows the reference paper.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when updgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.8:

  - The ``scikits.learn`` package was renamed ``sklearn``. There is
    still a ``scikits.learn`` package alias for backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bscikits.learn\b/sklearn/g'

  - Estimators no longer accept model parameters as ``fit`` arguments:
    instead all parameters must be only be passed as constructor
    arguments or using the now public ``set_params`` method inhereted
    from :class:`base.BaseEstimator`.

    Some estimators can still accept keyword arguments on the ``fit``
    but this is restricted to data-dependent values (e.g. a Gram matrix
    or an affinity matrix that are precomputed from the ``X`` data matrix.

  - The ``cross_val`` package has been renamed to ``cross_validation``
    although there is also a ``cross_val`` package alias in place for
    backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bcross_val\b/cross_validation/g'

  - The ``score_func`` argument of the
    ``sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`` function is now expected
    to accept ``y_test`` and ``y_predicted`` as only arguments for
    classification and regression tasks or ``X_test`` for unsupervised
    estimators.

  - ``gamma`` parameter for support vector machine algorithms is set
    to ``1 / n_features`` by default, instead of ``1 / n_samples``.

  - The ``sklearn.hmm`` has been marked as orphaned: it will be removed
    from scikit-learn in version 0.11 unless someone steps up to
    contribute documentation, examples and fix lurking numerical
    stability issues.

  - ``sklearn.neighbors`` has been made into a submodule.  The two previously
    available estimators, ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor``
    have been marked as deprecated.  Their functionality has been divided
    among five new classes: ``NearestNeighbors`` for unsupervised neighbors
    searches, ``KNeighborsClassifier`` & ``RadiusNeighborsClassifier``
    for supervised classification problems, and ``KNeighborsRegressor``
    & ``RadiusNeighborsRegressor`` for supervised regression problems.

  - ``sklearn.ball_tree.BallTree`` has been moved to
    ``sklearn.neighbors.BallTree``.  Using the former will generate a warning.

  - ``sklearn.linear_model.LARS()`` and related classes (LassoLARS,
    LassoLARSCV, etc.) have been renamed to
    ``sklearn.linear_model.Lars()``.

  - All distance metrics and kernels in ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise`` now have a Y
    parameter, which by default is None. If not given, the result is the distance
    (or kernel similarity) between each sample in Y. If given, the result is the
    pairwise distance (or kernel similarity) between samples in X to Y.

  - ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise.l1_distance`` is now called ``manhattan_distance``,
    and by default returns the pairwise distance. For the component wise distance,
    set the parameter ``sum_over_features`` to ``False``.

Backward compatibilty package aliases and other deprecated classes and
functions will be removed in version 0.11.

.. _changes_0_6:

0.6
===

scikit-learn 0.6 was released on december 2010. It is marked by the
inclusion of several new modules and a general renaming of old
ones. It is also marked by the inclusion of new example, including
applications to real-world datasets.


Changelog
---------

  - New `stochastic gradient
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html>`_ descent
    module by Peter Prettenhofer. The module comes with complete
    documentation and examples.

  - Improved svm module: memory consumption has been reduced by 50%,
    heuristic to automatically set class weights, possibility to
    assign weights to samples (see
    :ref:`example_svm_plot_weighted_samples.py` for an example).

  - New :ref:`gaussian_process` module by Vincent Dubourg. This module
    also has great documentation and some very neat examples. See
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_regression.py` or
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_probabilistic_classification_after_regression.py`
    for a taste of what can be done.

  - It is now possible to use liblinear’s Multi-class SVC (option
    multi_class in :class:`svm.LinearSVC`)

  - New features and performance improvements of text feature
    extraction.

  - Improved sparse matrix support, both in main classes
    (:class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`) as in modules
    sklearn.svm.sparse and sklearn.linear_model.sparse.

  - Lots of cool new examples and a new section that uses real-world
    datasets was created. These include:
    :ref:`example_applications_face_recognition.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_plot_species_distribution_modeling.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_svm_gui.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py` and
    others.

  - Faster :ref:`least_angle_regression` algorithm. It is now 2x
    faster than the R version on worst case and up to 10x times faster
    on some cases.

  - Faster coordinate descent algorithm. In particular, the full path
    version of lasso (:func:`linear_model.lasso_path`) is more than
    200x times faster than before.

  - It is now possible to get probability estimates from a
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` model.

  - module renaming: the glm module has been renamed to linear_model,
    the gmm module has been included into the more general mixture
    model and the sgd module has been included in linear_model.

  - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.

      complete `class reference
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html>`_.

Fixes
-----

    - API changes: adhere variable names to PEP-8, give more
      meaningful names.

    - Fixes for svm module to run on a shared memory context
      (multiprocessing).

    - It is again possible to generate latex (and thus PDF) from the
      sphinx docs.

Examples
--------

    - new examples using some of the mlcomp datasets:
      :ref:`example_mlcomp_sparse_document_classification.py`,
      :ref:`example_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`

    - Many more examaples. `See here
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html>`_
      the full list of examples.


External dependencies
---------------------

    - Joblib is now a dependencie of this package, although it is
      shipped with (sklearn.externals.joblib).

Removed modules
---------------

    - Module ann (Artificial Neural Networks) has been removed from
      the distribution. Users wanting this sort of algorithms should
      take a look into pybrain.

Misc
----

    - New sphinx theme for the web page.
