Ensemble methods
================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.ensemble

The goal of **ensemble methods** is to combine the predictions of several
models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve
generalizability / robustness over a single model.

Two families of ensemble methods are usually distinguished:

- In **averaging methods**, the driving principle is to build several
  models independently and then to average their predictions. On average,
  the combined model is usually better than any of the single model
  because its variance is reduced.

  **Examples:** Bagging methods, :ref:`Forests of randomized trees <forest>`...

- By contrast, in **boosting methods**, models are built sequentially and one
  tries to reduce the bias of the combined model. The motivation is to combine
  several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.

  **Examples:** AdaBoost, Least Squares Boosting, :ref:`Gradient Tree Boosting <gradient_boosting>`, ...


.. _forest:

Forests of randomized trees
===========================

The :mod:`sklearn.ensemble` module includes two averaging algorithms based
on randomized :ref:`decision trees <tree>`: the RandomForest algorithm
and the Extra-Trees method. Both algorithms are perturb-and-combine
techniques [B1998]_ specifically designed for trees. This means a diverse
set of classifiers is created by introducing randomness in the classifier
construction.  The prediction of the ensemble is given as the averaged
prediction of the individual classifiers.

As other classifiers, forest classifiers have to be fitted with two
arrays: an array X of size ``[n_samples, n_features]`` holding the
training samples, and an array Y of size ``[n_samples]`` holding the
target values (class labels) for the training samples::

    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
    >>> Y = [0, 1]
    >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
    >>> clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

Random Forests
--------------
In random forests (see :class:`RandomForestClassifier` and
:class:`RandomForestRegressor` classes), each tree in the ensemble is
built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample)
from the training set. In addition, when splitting a node during the
construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the
best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the
best split among a random subset of the features. As a result of this
randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with
respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging,
its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the
increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.

In contrast to the original publication [B2001]_, the scikit-learn
implementation combines classifiers by averaging their probabilistic
prediction, instead of letting each classifier vote for a single class.


Extremely Randomized Trees
--------------------------

In extremely randomized trees (see :class:`ExtraTreesClassifier`
and :class:`ExtraTreesRegressor` classes), randomness goes one step
further in the way splits are computed. As in random forests, a random
subset of candidate features is used, but instead of looking for the
most discriminative thresholds, thresholds are drawn at random for each
candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is
picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance
of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase
in bias::

    >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    >>> X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, centers=100,
    ...     random_state=0)

    >>> clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, min_samples_split=1,
    ...     random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean()                             # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.978...

    >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=None,
    ...     min_samples_split=1, random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean()                             # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.999...

    >>> clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=None,
    ...     min_samples_split=1, random_state=0)
    >>> scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y)
    >>> scores.mean() > 0.999
    True

Parameters
----------

The main parameters to adjust when using these methods is ``n_estimators``
and ``max_features``. The former is the number of trees in the forest. The
larger the better, but also the longer it will take to compute. In
addition, note that results will stop getting significantly better
beyond a critical number of trees. The latter is the size of the random
subsets of features to consider when splitting a node. The lower the
greater the reduction of variance, but also the greater the increase in
bias. Empiricial good default values are ``max_features=n_features``
for regression problems, and ``max_features=sqrt(n_features)`` for
classification tasks (where ``n_features`` is the number of features
in the data). The best results are also usually reached when setting
``max_depth=None`` in combination with ``min_samples_split=1`` (i.e.,
when fully developping the trees). Bear in mind though that these values
are usually not optimal. The best parameter values should always be cross-
validated. In addition, note that bootstrap samples are used by default
in random forests (``bootstrap=True``) while the default strategy is to
use the original dataset for building extra-trees (``bootstrap=False``).

When training on large datasets, where runtime and memory requirements
are important, it might also be beneficial to adjust the ``min_density``
parameter, that controls a heuristic for speeding up computations in
each tree.  See :ref:`Complexity of trees<tree_complexity>` for details.


Parallelization
---------------

Finally, this module also features the parallel construction of the trees
and the parallel computation of the predictions through the ``n_jobs``
parameter. If ``n_jobs=k`` then computations are partitioned into
``k`` jobs, and run on ``k`` cores of the machine. If ``n_jobs=-1``
then all cores available on the machine are used. Note that because of
inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear
(i.e., using ``k`` jobs will unfortunately not be ``k`` times as
fast). Significant speedup can still be achieved though when building
a large number of trees, or when building a single tree requires a fair
amount of time (e.g., on large datasets).

.. _gradient_boosting:


Gradient Tree Boosting
======================

`Gradient Tree Boosting <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting>`_
or Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is a generalization
of boosting to arbitrary
differentiable loss functions. GBRT is an accurate and effective
off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and
classification problems.  Gradient Tree Boosting models are used in a
variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.

The advantages of GBRT are:

  + Natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features)

  + Predictive power

  + Robustness to outliers in input space (via robust loss functions)

The disadvantages of GBRT are:

  + Scalability, due to the sequential nature of boosting it can
    hardly be parallelized.

The module :mod:`sklearn.ensemble` provides methods
for both classification and regression via gradient boosted regression
trees.

Classification
==============

:class:`GradientBoostingClassifier` supports both binary and multi-class
classification via the deviance loss function (``loss='deviance'``).
The following example shows how to fit a gradient boosting classifier
with 100 decision stumps as weak learners::

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_hastie_10_2
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

    >>> X, y = make_hastie_10_2(random_state=0)
    >>> X_train, X_test = X[:2000], X[2000:]
    >>> y_train, y_test = y[:2000], y[2000:]

    >>> clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learn_rate=1.0,
    ...     max_depth=1, random_state=0).fit(X_train, y_train)
    >>> clf.score(X_test, y_test)                 # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.913...

The number of weak learners (i.e. regression trees) is controlled by the
parameter ``n_estimators``; The maximum depth of each tree is controlled via
``max_depth``. The ``learn_rate`` is a hyper-parameter in the range (0.0, 1.0]
that controls overfitting via :ref:`shrinkage <gradient_boosting_shrinkage>`.

.. note: Classification with more than 2 classes requires the induction
         of ``n_classes`` regression trees at each at each iteration,
         thus, the total number of induced trees equals
         ``n_classes * n_estimators``. For datasets with a large number
         of classes we strongly recommend to use
         :class:`RandomForestClassifier` as an alternative to GBRT.

Regression
==========

:class:`GradientBoostingRegressor` supports a number of different loss
functions for regression which can be specified via the argument
``loss``. Currently, supported are least squares (``loss='ls'``) and
least absolute deviation (``loss='lad'``), which is more robust w.r.t.
outliers. See [F2001]_ for detailed information.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_friedman1
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

    >>> X, y = make_friedman1(n_samples=1200, random_state=0, noise=1.0)
    >>> X_train, X_test = X[:200], X[200:]
    >>> y_train, y_test = y[:200], y[200:]
    >>> clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learn_rate=1.0,
    ...     max_depth=1, random_state=0, loss='ls').fit(X_train, y_train)

The figure below shows the results of applying :class:`GradientBoostingRegressor`
with least squares loss and 500 base learners to the Boston house-price dataset
(see :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`).
The plot on the left shows the train and test error at each iteration.
Plots like these are often used for early stopping. The plot on the right
shows the feature importances which can be optained via the ``feature_importance``
property.

Mathematical formulation
========================

GBRT considers additive models of the following form:

  .. math::

    F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \gamma_m h_m(x)

where :math:`h_m(x)` are the basis functions which are usually called
*weak learners* in the context of boosting. Gradient Tree Boosting
uses :ref:`decision trees <tree>` of fixed size as weak
learners. Decision trees have a number of abilities that make them
valuable for boosting, namely the ability to handle data of mixed type
and the ability to model complex functions.

Similar to other boosting algorithms GBRT builds the additive model in
a forward stagewise fashion:

  .. math::

    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \gamma_m h_m(x)

At each stage the decision tree :math:`h_m(x)` is choosen that
minimizes the loss function :math:`L` given the current model
:math:`F_{m-1}` and its fit :math:`F_{m-1}(x_i)`

  .. math::

    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \arg\min_{h} \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i,
    F_{m-1}(x_i) - h(x))

The initial model :math:`F_{0}` is problem specific, for least-squares
regression one usually chooses the mean of the target values.

.. note:: The initial model can also be specified via the ``init``
          argument. The passed object has to implement ``fit`` and ``predict``.

Gradient Boosting attempts to solve this minimization problem
numerically via steepest descent: The steepest descent direction is
the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current
model :math:`F_{m-1}` which can be calculated for any differentiable
loss function:

  .. math::

    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \gamma_m \sum_{i=1}^{n} \nabla_F L(y_i,
    F_{m-1}(x_i))

Where the step length :math:`\gamma_m` is choosen using line search:

  .. math::

    \gamma_m = \arg\min_{\gamma} \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i)
    - \gamma \frac{\partial L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i))}{\partial F_{m-1}(x_i)})

The algorithms for regression and classification
only differ in the concrete loss function used.


Loss Functions
--------------

The following loss functions are supported and can be specified using
the parameter ``loss``:

  * Regression

    * Least squares (``'ls'``): The natural choice for regression due
      to its superior computational properties. The initial model is
      given by the mean of the target values.
    * Least absolute deviation (``'lad'``): A robust loss function for
      regression. The initial model is given by the median of the
      target values.

  * Classification

    * Binomial deviance (``'deviance'``): The negative binomial
      log-likelihood loss function for binary classification (provides
      probability estimates).  The initial model is given by the
      log odds-ratio.
    * Multinomial deviance (``'deviance'``): The negative multinomial
      log-likelihood loss function for multi-class classification with
      ``n_classes`` mutually exclusive classes. It provides
      probability estimates.  The initial model is given by the
      prior probability of each class. At each iteration ``n_classes``
      regression trees have to be constructed which makes GBRT rather
      inefficient for data sets with a large number of classes.

Regularization
==============

.. _gradient_boosting_shrinkage:

Shrinkage
---------

[F2001]_ proposed a simple regularization strategy that scales
the contribution of each weak learner by a factor :math:`\nu`:

.. math::

    F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \nu \gamma_m h_m(x)

The parameter :math:`\nu` is also called the **learning rate** because
it scales the step length the the gradient descent procedure; it can
be set via the ``learn_rate`` parameter.

The parameter ``learn_rate`` strongly interacts with the parameter
``n_estimators``, the number of weak learners to fit. Smaller values
of ``learn_rate`` require larger numbers of weak learners to maintain
a constant training error. Empirical evidence suggests that small
values of ``learn_rate`` favor better test error. [HTF2009]_
recommend to set the learning rate to a small constant
(e.g. ``learn_rate <= 0.1``) and choose ``n_estimators`` by early
stopping. For a more detailed discussion of the interaction between
``learn_rate`` and ``n_estimators`` see [R2007]_.

Subsampling
-----------

[F1999]_ proposed stochastic gradient boosting, which combines gradient
boosting with bootstrap averaging (bagging). At each iteration
the base classifier is trained on a fraction ``subsample`` of
the available training data.
The subsample is drawn without replacement.
A typical value of ``subsample`` is 0.5.

The figure below illustrates the effect of shrinkage and subsampling
on the goodness-of-fit of the model. We can clearly see that shrinkage
outperforms no-shrinkage. Subsampling with shrinkage can further increase
the accuracy of the model. Subsampling without shrinkage, on the other hand,
does poorly.
