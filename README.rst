scikit-learn
============

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the AUTHORS.rst file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

**Note** `scikit-learn` was previously referred to as `scikits.learn`.
